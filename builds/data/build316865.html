Hey dude, I got a few suggestions to make that I think would make this build overall more effective.<br><br>- Forget about Concentration, with 15 ranks you won't be able to hold one single spell or resist any Taunts, so don't bother. Get more Heal instead. I was thinking to advise you to get Taunt (and dropping both Heal and Concentration), but the way you leveling goes (and there's not much to in terms of that), you'd only use it for the first 7 levels, and then it'd only be updated at level 21 (24 if you follow all my changes). Still an option if you want to consider it.<br><br>- The 2 first attribute stats go to Charisma, but IMO they should go to Strength. Early on is when a higher Strength score will make the most difference, in terms of both AB and damage, before the BAB progression starts to become relevant. At least the first 4 Stat increases should go to Strength, then you can start taking Charisma.<br><br>- You take Divine Shield in the mid-epics as a general feat, why don't you alter your pre-epic spread to Paladin (8) / Champion of Torm (8) / Weapon Master (4), take Knockdown with that CoT bonus Feat and Divine Shield at level 18.<br><br>- Once in the epics, nothing is better in terms of AB than Epic Weapon Focus, so if you go for the new spread, you should take Epic Weapon Focus at level 21, then Armor Skin on that last Champion of Torm bonus feat, while leaving Epic Prowess to be taken at level 40.<br><br>- Use a Battleaxe, it's a Slashing weapon, so any party member can cast Keen Edge on it. If you're a solo man, or if keen weapons are common, don't bother.<br><br>Here's how my suggested alterations would look like:<br><br>1. Paladin (1) – Weapon Focus (Battleaxe)<br>2. Paladin (2)<br>3. Paladin (3) – Power Attack<br>4. Paladin (4) +1 STR<br>5. Paladin (5)<br>6. Paladin (6) – Divine Might<br>7. Paladin (7)<br>8. Champion of Torm (1) +1 STR<br>9. Champion of Torm (2) – Dodge, Mobility<br>10. Champion of Torm (3)<br>11. Champion of Torm (4) - Expertise<br>12. Champion of Torm (5) – Spring Attack +1 Str<br>13.

Weapon Master (1) – Weapon of Choice (Battleaxe), +1 STR<br>17. Weapon Master (2)<br>18. Paladin (8) - Divine Shield<br>19. Weapon Master (3)<br>20. Weapon Master (4) +1 CHA<br>21. Weapon Master (5) – Epic Weapon Focus (Battleaxe)<br>22. Weapon Master (6)<br>23. Weapon Master (7)<br>24. Paladin (9) – Great Strength I +1 CHA<br>25. Champion of Torm (9)<br>26. Champion of Torm (10) – Armor Skin<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>40.

Yours doesn't, and it would be impossible to try to fix that, therefore it's of utmost importance that you have enough Strength to hit stuff up until you get at least 15 Paladin levels to have access to all spells.<br><br>Despite the fact that I made so many suggestions to improve it, I actually like the build.

I am not in favor of giving advices that involve class changes, because dropping a class radically changes the build, unless it's an extreme case. Being a novice builder, you gotta explore the classes you know, and build within your means. I remember when I was starting out, many of my builds involved Weapon Master, because that extra threat range and multiplier looked too juicy to me. It's easier to know that you'll score more criticals and do more damage than it is to understand how to generate Sneak Attacks, how Death Attack works, how shifting works for Druids, know the spellbook for all the classes: you gotta start somewhere. This build is what we here in Brazil would call "feijoada" (which is basically rice and black beans). Feijoada is the most common and worldwide known Brazilian typical food. It's the basic, the simple, the ordinary. That's what this build is. <br><br>Sure the build becomes pretty much a one-trick pony and has some deficiencies because of the class-combo, but it does make sense. Paladin is the RP base of the build, CoT comes to further enhance the saves and provide the bonus feats to help match the requirements for WM. Increased multiplier and ki critical given by WM have a good synergy with Paladin damage buffs, which all (except for smites) multiply on critical hits. To me, this combo has enough synergies to make a good build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> .<br><br>Take it EZ!<script type="text/javascript"><!--

Is it a "poor" build?  No.  Not at all.  The thing when you mix pal, cot, and wm together is, where's the diversity?  While it is perfectly acceptable to do this sort of combo, the reason to combine one class with another is to get something that the other class DOESNT get.  <br><br>Here, Pal gives access to Div might and spells (saves).  COT gives saves and feats (ignore the other stuff cuz it isnt that important).  WM gives crit damage and crit range.  No tumble.  No umd. etc<br><br>WHen you mix a build like this it is extremely easy to RP as each chosen class is so similar to the others that there is really no challenge in it.  <br><br>I hope none of what i say is taken negatively.  I dont mean it that way.  I was just making the point to maybe help you for the next build by getting you to ask, "what is this build missing and how can i get some of it?"<script type="text/javascript"><!--

There are several points one can start from when critiquing a build.  I do like to start with the conception, as, often, it is the basic concept of the build that I may find flawed (such as this one, as I don't think it's a very good combo).  From there, one follows by critiquing the build with the assumption that one is trying to make the best use of the basic concept.  That's the nuts and bolts. Some guys are more into the nuts and bolts, some guys like the whole pie.  I'm a pie kinda guy.  Point is, there's value to both those perspectives, though often, the greater picture critique is rather brief.<br><br>Anyhoo...  I guess a discussion of the philosophy behind build critiques is a might bit off topic.<br><br>Edit: That's a damn sloppy sig I've got.

Paladin smites will add CoT levels when dealing damage, and the save bonuses stack together too (up to the cap of +20). What is being debated here is the presence of Weapon Master. Onion says that you have to sacrifice too much to have only 7 levels of it. Not only do you sacrifice MANY pre-epic feats, but also your starting stats. It has synergy with the build, like I told you, but like Avado said, it's of the same "type" as Paladin / CoT (a fighter-type class with few skill points and a similar set of class skills). What he suggested was for you to take a third class to be able to get stuff that you don't have access to with Pal / CoT, like UMD, Tumble, Evasion (which is really sweet with your high saves), etc.., but from a RP point of view, that's kind of tough. If the guy has a problem knocking people down, I can imagine no reason for him to have Sneak Attack either. IMO it's a decent concept as it is now. Maybe if you went Pal 26 CoT 10 Monk 4 you could at least have 40 Tumble and a lot of nice feats, including Monk Speed.<br><br>Anyway, personally, I'd leave it as it is with the changes I have already suggested.<br><br>Take it EZ!<script type="text/javascript"><!--

Yah, a dwarf may be sub-optimal for a paladin, but if you started with the premise that you wanted a dwarven paladin, I'd recommend a pally26/CoT10/rogue4 or a Pally26/CoT4/rogue10.  Monk, I suppose, would be the next best thing if rogue was considered undesirable.  In any event, yes, it's the WM that I have the biggest problem with.  It just aint worth it.  At the same time, I don't think it's a horrendous investment or anything, and the build you have here is certainly playable, but it's not what I'd advise.<br><br>Also, for the record, the original build doesn't seem to have a problem using KD.  Thousands of words have been written about pally/rogues, and pallys with SA, and I really don't feel the need to add to that discussion here, but, suffices to say, if you have no moral objection, rogue is the best third class available.<script type="text/javascript"><!--
