dire mace is a good enough weapon, its just that when most people go with dual wielding, they want the option of switching out one side for a shield.  with any of the double weapons that is not an option without lowering AB or focusing in another weapon.  with a lot of builds it is not possible.<br><br>but if you are looking are a simple solution, go to the epic character build page and look at the kukri master.  simply substitute kukri for dire mace.  swap out any other feats (except the dual wielding ones) you find are pointless, and voila!<br><br>also any build geared toward a double sword (there are a few out there, you just have to look real hard - i have one called the divine blades of torm (cleric/rogue/cot)) and swap the sword for the mace.<br><br>just my two cents.  hope that helps.<br><br>-c<br>_________________<br>"Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."<script type="text/javascript"><!--
