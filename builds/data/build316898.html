Sure. The main reason is Ranger gets Dual Wield and Improved Two-weapon Fighting feats free. A fighter build requires Ambidexterity and 15 dexterity to get that feat.<br><br>You'd have to drop too many points from wisdom, strength, intelligence and con to get the required 15 Dex.<br><br>Another minor bonus is the wisdom required for Cleric spells opens up level 2 Ranger spells, so you can buff Hide &amp; Move silently with Camouflage and One with the Land.

I agree with onion, however, that Ranger in this build makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. And I am against suggestions to change classes, but I just can't see the synergy, especially on a Strength build. There are MANY fundamental flaws in your build, some of them, had you read my <script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewtopic.html", "8061", "13422", "316836", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>guide</a>, could've been avoided. I will try to point them out:<br><br>1- Cleric has Divine Power, so AB is not really a concern. There goes one of the reasons not to take Ranger. Fighter (like onion said), gains a bonus feat every 2 levels and gives you access to Weapon Specialization / Epic Weapon Specialization. There goes another. And finally, the Dual Wield feats only work with NO ARMOR OR LIGHT ARMOR, and your DEX score is 8, so if you do that, your AC will be VERY LOW. And there goes the 3rd one. So what's left? Camouflage? I refuse to believe that's it. Ranger here makes absolutely no sense in this build in terms of synergy.<br><br>2- You're making a rookie mistake by taking the first level as Cleric. At level 1, your skill points are multiplied by 4, so you should start with the class that has more skill points to have more final skill points at the cost of NOTHING. Also, you should take Monk at levels 7, 12 and 17 for Tumble dumps.<br><br>3- Your build is not optimized. Cleric 24 does nothing, so you might as well end at Cleric 23. That would make it so that you don't have to wait till level 40 to get KD and IKD. Monk 7 also gives you Wholeness of Body, which sucks, but is still better than nothing.<br><br>4- You only get enough Wisdom to cast level 8 spells at Cleric 21. That is 6 levels without level 8 spells, a very bad deal. You can only cast level 9 spells at level 39. OMG!<br><br>To decide which class to replace Ranger with, you need to decide what you're going to change in your build. There are several alternatives: Going Fighter or CoT if feats is what you're looking for (CoT has Great Wisdom to select from the Bonus Feat list, which means you can spend all your stat points in Strength, and boosts saves, while Fighter gives you access to WS / EWS and you can go past 10 to get more Bonus Feats if you need them). I would definitely also drop Intelligence, since Monks will get KD and IKD even if they don't meet the requirements. That would leave you enough room to start with Wisdom 16 and save up an Epic Feat. The changes needed are so severe that I cannot think past these initial major adjustments. You already have enough to think about, so I'll leave you to it. Just please don't take it personally, I am discussing your build, not attacking you <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  <br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 08/12/10 10:56</span></i></p><script type="text/javascript"><!--

Thanks Maximillian Kane for the feed back. To address the points raised:<br><br>1. Divine Power whilst good, doesn't last forever even when extended compared to a BAB 16. I would still use Divine Power however to increase the BAB to 20.<br><br>Dex score 8 is low, yes. But do not forget a Cleric has excellent buffs and Dex can easily become 20 with spells/items in low to mid magic worlds. The Wis score of 20 easily becomes 32 again with Cleric buffs and items... for me in the module I play that is. So, buffing Dex and Wis can give up to + 16 AC with robes.<br><br>Full Plate builds with 15 dex in a low to mid magic would get + 14 AC at best, granted its permanent. (8 + 5 + 1 Dex Bonus.)<br><br>Ranger was taken to be a variant from Figher/CoT builds. Whilst the extra feats of those classes are good (and no doubt CoT bonus to saving throws), you don't have to play that class if you don't want to. And, no, Camouflage was not the purpose of the build <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif"> <br><br>2. I had forgotten about taken Cleric 1 as a mistake, thanks for reminding me. Ideally Monk or Ranger (fighter/CoT if that's the build change) is better and offers more skills at lvl 1.<br><br>You will note I have taken Monk at 7, 17, 27 &amp; 40. Yes 12 and would be more optimized, but I felt it not necessary. The tumble dump I felt could wait a little later as, seriously, + 1 at 12 vs taking the + 2 at 17 instead for tumble dumps rarely causes a problem for me.<br><br>3. Cleric 24 does more than you have observed and is optimised in some respect. Cleric 24 ensures Greater Dispelling will not debuff the build which is a common spell in a low to mid magic world.<br><br>4. This was an issue I struggled to find a suitable solution for without delaying Dev Crit to late and hoped someone could help me find an answer for. Obviously not. <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_smile.gif"> <br><br>Ranger does seem a weaker option but, Cl/M/F has been done so many times before and more so has Cl/M/CoT. Perhaps because the other builders overall are the stronger option, but doesn't mean they have to be the only.<script type="text/javascript"><!--

Hey man, allright you seem like a guy that doesn't take criticism personally, that's awesome, so I'll try to illustrate my point:<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Ranger was taken to be a variant from Figher/CoT builds.

It also DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. Ranger COULD make sense if this was a DEX-build (and even then there would be better options), but as a STR build it just doesn't. Also, it sort of conflicts with your domain of choice because it has Cat's Grace as a class spell, leaving only Aura of Vitality to be a useful spell. Perhaps if you're so bent on going Ranger, you could choose the Travel domain for Haste spell. With your Charisma score, Battle Mastery is useless. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;Dex score 8 is low, yes.

I mean, if you don't Dual Wield you could have another Magic Vestment cast on your shield, getting you 8 + 5 + 3 + 5, which adds up to +21. But I am not suggesting that you go for Full Plate.<br><br>See, the way I see this is like this: Ranger as a 3rd class (or 2nd) is only the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot of conflicts in this build:<br><br>- Cleric / Monk is MOST USEFUL as a DEX build because the bonuses only apply with no armor. So if you're not going for a DEX build, you're already handicapping yourself. <br><br>- Similarly, Cleric has MANY DAMAGE BUFFS, which don't make a that much of a difference if you have DevCrit, unless everyone succeeds in the save against your critical, which will make it mostly useless. <br><br>So either way you're getting conflicting features in your character. By going STR you don't take full advantage of Monk / Cleric synergy and by getting Devastating Critical you diminish the usefulness of Cleric damage buffs. There's more:<br><br>- Hide and Move Silently with a -1 base modifier means that ANYONE with 43 listen will see you. That doesn't make any sense either. <br><br>- Kamas aren't the best weapon for a DevCrit build, because of the reduced threat range. With Keen Edge and Improved Critical, you'll still only get 18-20 threat range. And Keen Edge isn't a Cleric spell.<br><br>- If you're going to walk around in robes, you should be doing everything you can to raise your DEX, instead you're doing all you can to TRASH it. My point is, you could take 2 or even 4 points out of INT and put them in DEX, plus another 2 or 4 points from CON and do the same. If you start with 14 DEX, you can still cap it, only at 26, which gives you a +8 modifier.<br><br>If building is about coherence, you're going against it with your choices. And getting KD / IKD at level 40, really, what good does it do?<br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;2.

My guess is, delay DevCrit for 3 levels, won't kill ya <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"> <br><br>I'm sorry I can't be more helpful than this, but to me a build has to make sense for me to suggest tweaks. As it is I can only suggest MAJOR changes. Try going Fighter 10 Cleric 23 Monk 7. That won't make you that much more dispellable and you'll be able to get Weapon Specialization, Epic Weapon Specialization and one more pre-epic feat, while your Epic Feats will remain unchanged. You'll lose Barkskin and Camouflage. IMO a good trade.Go Cleric 12 Fighter 4 Monk 4 pre-epic, then get Monk 6 ASAP for KD / IKD and then at 40 you'll do your final Tumble dump with Monk 7. If you go CoT, then leave all CoT levels except one to take in epics, but that will mean you won't be able to cast many buffs for a long time.<br><br>One last comment. Divine Power is probably THE SINGLE BEST CLERIC SPELL in the world. Extended Divine Power even better. Memorize AT THE VERY LEAST 4 DP and 2 Ext. DPs in EVERY CASE SCENARIO.<br><br>Anyway, I'm done trying to suggest radical changes to your build, and although I understand the reasoning behind your choices, I hope you now understand the flaws in your reasoning. <br><br>Take it EZ!<script type="text/javascript"><!--

I must be getting soft when Onion and Max are the strong arms <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_razz.gif">    I honestly didnt mind this build.<br><br>I do have some inputs however!  LOL<br><br>I have played just a few clerics in my day, and, while it doesnt make sense to most players to have the spell level possibility WITHOUT having the wisdom to cast, it really isnt a big deal.  Levels 7 thru 9 for the cleric are great, however, when one is skilled (and i stress SKILLED) up to lv 6 spells works just fine!  I mean you have your main buffs!  You have Blade barrier (the boss killa)!  What else do you need?  YES, you do need firestorm, sov, and for undead mass heal, but the cleric is manageable with lv 6 spells!  Trust me!  I have built MANY clerics with wisdom of 16 to lv 30 and did just fine.<br><br>When it comes to DP not having the duration, WHAT!!  LOL  While i am sure that there are other usable lv 4 spells, NONE are better than DP.  I can see subbing ONE slot for another spell, but ALL lv 4 slots MUST be DP!  A cleric needs extended.  Because it is so reliant on spells for stuff, it needs to have the double duration (cept for DF which saddly doesnt extend <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_frown.gif">   ).  I mean, even at lv 40, extended DP goes 80 rounds!  80!  I have used it and truly enjoyed not having to recast DP.  So in all honesty, lv 4 is DP and lv 5 slots are ext DP.  Any lv 5 spells should be ext to lv 6 anyway so you WILL have LOTS of DPs!  Rarely did I ever run out in a PVM environment.  <br><br>I know people will disagree with what i say but they is rookies and have only read about the cleric or played it once or twice!  I have played almost every variant you could do with it and know what works.  <br><br>While what Max says has validity, DONT ever let someone dash your idea if you think its good!  Not every build is min/max, and that isnt the point of it.  THe point is to build an idea and get it out there.  Who knows, someone may take your idea and make something you never considered BECAUSE of what you did.<script type="text/javascript"><!--
