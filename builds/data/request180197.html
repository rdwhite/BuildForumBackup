I need a Druid Assassin build, max level is 20, unless i get lucky, so none of that.. But other then that i'm pretty much open to any suggestions, was thinking 1 monk level early on to add to playability and another later soit wouldn't be purely for power, also align changes won't be a problem towards chaotic and evil, but worse the other way.. Hope anybody has any good ideas for this or i'll have to do a 13/7 combo <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif"><br>_________________<br>"First you get the spoons, then you get the women" -Hawk<script type="text/javascript"><!--
