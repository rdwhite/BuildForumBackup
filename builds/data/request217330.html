I've been trying to build an effective Monk/Paladin type build with maybe some Champion of Torm levels in.  Make it Charisma based and give it a weapon and armor using the Monk for the immunities and SR.  Then use Divine Might/Divine Shield to make it really combat effective, along with the various paladin spells.  Can someone throw a good one together that'd be effective against nearly any opponent?  I think they call it PvE, but I'm not sure.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>King Harbromm<script type="text/javascript"><!--
