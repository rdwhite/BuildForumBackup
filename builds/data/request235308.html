Need a good roleplaying elven archer build with a max lvl of 30. Thinking about having some bard in there, or cleric for roleplaying purposes. Also if it has prestige classes it has to have enough of a certain class to be able to take it on the server I play on (example: RDD requires 12, bard or sorc lvls to take)<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By ArcticDwarf900 on 03/28/06 21:52</span></i></p><script type="text/javascript"><!--

You're not giving enough information about your server....<br><br>Elven archer sounds already like an Arcane Archer to me..... if you're based on 30 levels, maybe a fighter combination for EWS will be good. Of course the needed Bard or Wizard level.<br><br>Also, what would you define by "good roleplaying"?<script type="text/javascript"><!--
