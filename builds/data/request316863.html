Hail, members of this wonderful guild. I seem to be one of the very few remaining members who is actually still playing this game. I have been experimenting recently with some deliciously evil classes, like Blackguard, and now it's only natural that I evolved into Assassins. I wanted to explore the fact that Wizard's primary casting stat is Intelligence, the same that affects Death Attack DC, but without de-characterizing the Assassin by not using stealth skills. The synergy is only apparent, since you need 3 mutually exclusive things to make it work properly: highish AB (no HiPS, so no re-hiding in combat), many Wizard levels, many Assassin levels. Since you cannot have all, and Assassin is the main focus of this build, I have managed to come up with a sketch:<br><br>Ranger(8), Illusionist(10), Assassin(22), Elf<br><br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 18 (34)<br>CON: 12<br>WIS: 12<br>INT: 14 (16)<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Elf: (Hardiness vs. Enchantments, Keen Sense, Low-light Vision, Skill Affinity: Listen, Skill Affinity: Search, Skill Affinity: Spot, Sleeplessness)<br>01: Ranger(1): Weapon Finesse, Favored Enemy: Undeads, {Dual Wield}<br>02: Ranger(2)<br>03: Ranger(3): Knockdown<br>04: Ranger(4): DEX+1, (DEX=19)<br>05: Ranger(5): Favored Enemy: Constructs<br>06: Assassin(1): Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>07: Assassin(2): {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>08: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>09: Assassin(4): Improved Knockdown<br>10: Ranger(6)<br>11: Ranger(7)<br>12: Assassin(5): DEX+1, Improved Critical: Rapier, (DEX=21)<br>13: Assassin(6)<br>14: Illusionist(1): {Scribe Scroll}<br>15: Illusionist(2): Extend Spell<br>16: Illusionist(3): DEX+1, (DEX=22)<br>17: Illusionist(4)<br>18: Assassin(7): Blind Fight<br>19: Assassin(8)<br>20: Ranger(8): DEX+1, (DEX=23)<br>21: Illusionist(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, Great Intelligence I, (INT=15)<br>22: Assassin(9)<br>23: Assassin(10)<br>24: Assassin(11): DEX+1, Armor Skin, (DEX=24)<br>25: Assassin(12)<br>26: Assassin(13)<br>27: Assassin(14): Epic Prowess, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=25)<br>28: Assassin(15): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>29: Assassin(16)<br>30: Assassin(17): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=27)<br>31: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=28)<br>32: Illusionist(6): DEX+1, (DEX=29)<br>33: Illusionist(7): Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=30)<br>34: Illusionist(8)<br>35: Illusionist(9)<br>36: Assassin(19): DEX+1, Great Dexterity V, (DEX=32)<br>37: Assassin(20)<br>38: Assassin(21)<br>39: Illusionist(10): Great Dexterity VI, Great Intelligence II, (DEX=33), (INT=16)<br>40: Assassin(22): DEX+1, Improved Sneak Attack I, (DEX=34)<br><br>Hitpoints: 292<br>Skillpoints: 239<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 20/19/31<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +1, Mind Effects: +2, Traps: +2, Poison: +6<br>BAB: 26<br>AB (max, naked): 42 (melee), 39 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 32/35<br>Spell Casting: Ranger(2),Wizard(5)<br>Alignment Changes: 0<br><br>Hide 43(55), Listen 43(46), Move Silently 43(55), Set Trap 25(37), Spellcraft 4(7), Tumble 40(52), UMD 41(40)<br><br>This attempt of a build is so far the best I've been able to come up with, but I am really undecided between several possible level 40 spreads (the spread above is the one I chose to go with for now, but I was hoping to get some inputs from expert Assassin builders to make up my mind):<br><br>W 10 ASN 18 RGR 12 - for higher pre-epic BAB, lvl 3 Ranger spells and 1 more FE.<br><br>w 9 ASN 22 RGR 9 - Dual wielding expert with -4 AB in comparison to the previous one (-2 from pre-epic BAB and -2 from dual wielding).<br><br>Or any other inbetween like W 11 ASN 19 RGR 10 / W 10 / RGR 10 ASN 20, you get the picture. I wanna have at least 18 levels of Assassin, because otherwise, DA DC will be too low to paralyze anything.<br><br>So, what do you think?<br><br>Take it EZ!<script type="text/javascript"><!--

I think going Wizard-heavy would COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY ruin the build, simply because the 2 things that I was going for (good DA DC and decent AB) would not be achieved, and the whole purpose of even taking Assassin levels would be forfeit. Going Assassin-heavy, while not granting me the initial idea of bonus from this synergy, would still grant me the following:<br><br>- Important buffs such as: True Strike, Fox's Cunning, Cat's Grace, Invisibility and Improved Invisibility (from another source), Damage Shields, Flame Weapon, Greater Magic Weapon;<br><br>- 2 Great Intelligence feats as Wizard bonus feats;<br><br>- DA DC of 35 unbuffed, 41 with capped INT (easier to achieve with Fox's Cunning).<br><br>This build as it is has a good DA DC, 26 pre-epic BAB and 42 AB, which is no small feat for a 3/4 BAB/level mixed up with a 1/2 BAB/level character. <br><br><!-- BBCode Quote Start --><blockquote><div class="quote">Quote:&nbsp;As somewhat related suggestions, have you looked at one can do with a mostly pure wizard and a dash of assassin?

This build is very similar to The Hatchet by Cinnabar Din and the GrimBlade by grizzled_dwarflord, except I take Ranger instead of Fighter because I think Ranger has better synergy in that it has Hide and Move Silently as class skills, more skill points, has Fighter-type AB, Cat's Grace, and has the Camouflage spell, while Fighter only gives unnecessary bonus feats and WS / EWS.<br><br>IMO the build does get enough from each class to be quite powerful, although Evasion and Improved Evasion would be nice to have <img src="../../images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif">  .<br><br>Take it EZ!<p><i><span class="editby">Edited By Maximillian Kane on 08/04/10 11:23</span></i></p><script type="text/javascript"><!--
