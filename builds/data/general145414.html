Hey everyone I am in the process of rebuilding Robert Howards Conan world. Every country will be in it and alot of new things we are building. I will be using some of these epic builds in here for npcs. There are so many good builds in here and will piss off players and make it a good challenge. Any thoughts or ideas or help would be appreciated in the times to come. Right now we are working on the core mechanics we are going to use. We have the forums up and a website with the map we plan on using for the mod. <br><br>Thanks for ideas in advanced or any comments or suggestions<br>_________________<br><script type="text/javascript">PrintAnchor("viewguild.html", "9416", "", "", "", "", ' target="_blank"');</script>The Hyborian World-Conan the Barbarian PW </a><script type="text/javascript"><!--
