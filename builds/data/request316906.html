<i>I was just messing around with a build that I like to play on a PW that I must take a minimum of 5 levels in each class by level 40 and in some new proposed changes I benefit from having higher levels of a prestige class. I am just looking for some feedback on level progression and feats. It would be very helpful. I do need to keep the build a human. And the one point in heal is so I can use the heal kits in the world.</i><br><br>Race: Human<br><br>Abilities:<br>STR: 12<br>DEX: 16 (32)<br>CON: 16<br>WIS: 8<br>INT: 14<br>CHA: 8<br><br>Level Progression:<br><br>01: Rogue(1): Dodge, Expertise<br>02: Rogue(2): {Evasion}<br>03: Rogue(3): Weapon Finesse, {Uncanny Dodge I}<br>04: Rogue(4): DEX+1, (DEX=17)<br>05: Rogue(5)<br>06: Assassin(1): Weapon Focus: Rapier<br>07: Assassin(2)<br>08: Assassin(3): DEX+1, (DEX=18)<br>09: Assassin(4): Mobility<br>10: Shadowdancer(1): {Hide in Plain Sight}<br>11: Shadowdancer(2): {Darkvision}<br>12: Shadowdancer(3): DEX+1, Knockdown, (DEX=19)<br>13: Shadowdancer(4)<br>14: Assassin(5)<br>15: Assassin(6): Blind Fight<br>16: Assassin(7): DEX+1, (DEX=20)<br>17: Assassin(8)<br>18: Rogue(6): Improved Expertise<br>19: Rogue(7)<br>20: Rogue(8): DEX+1, (DEX=21)<br>21: Shadowdancer(5): Epic Weapon Focus: Rapier, {Defensive Roll}<br>22: Rogue(9)<br>23: Rogue(10): Crippling Strike<br>24: Shadowdancer(6): DEX+1, Great Dexterity I, (DEX=23)<br>25: Shadowdancer(7): {Slippery Mind}<br>26: Shadowdancer(8)<br>27: Shadowdancer(9): Great Dexterity II, (DEX=24)<br>28: Shadowdancer(10): DEX+1, {Improved Evasion}, (DEX=25)<br>29: Assassin(9)<br>30: Assassin(10): Epic Dodge<br>31: Assassin(11)<br>32: Assassin(12): DEX+1, (DEX=26)<br>33: Assassin(13): Armor Skin<br>34: Assassin(14): Great Dexterity III, (DEX=27)<br>35: Assassin(15)<br>36: Assassin(16): DEX+1, Great Dexterity IV, (DEX=29)<br>37: Assassin(17)<br>38: Assassin(18): Great Dexterity V, (DEX=30)<br>39: Assassin(19): Great Dexterity VI, (DEX=31)<br>40: Assassin(20): DEX+1, (DEX=32)<br><br>Statistics:<br>Hitpoints: 380<br>Skillpoints: 373<br>Saving Throws (Fortitude/Will/Reflex): 18/14/37<br>Saving Throw bonuses: Spells: +4, Traps: +5, Poison: +6<br>BAB: 25<br>AB (max, naked): 39 (melee), 36 (ranged)<br>AC (naked/mundane armor/shield only): 31/31<br><br>Skills:<br>Disable Trap 43(47), Heal 1(0), Hide 43(54), Move Silently 43(54), Open Lock 43(54), Search 43(45), Set Trap 36(49), Spellcraft 21(23), Tumble 43(54), UMD 36(35)<br>_________________<br>All Who Wander Are Not Lost<script type="text/javascript"><!--

Besides the obvious, i am not sure what to suggest as i have no idea what you think you wanted to make and what you ended up with!  LOL<br><br>In all honesty, a build is a bunch of classes mixed together and without a REASON behind it, how can anyone suggest improvements.<br><br>That said, I would go Elf (no xp penalty) to start with 18 or even 20 dex.  Not sure why 16 con to start.  Id drop it to 12 or even 10. I would also go with 10 str to get the dex as high as i could to start.  That way you get ED at 27.  <br><br>Other than that, there is no real challenge to this idea.  All three classes are basically the same (read interchangeable) so it doesnt matter much about lvl tweaks as long as you get the prereq for ED BEFORE 27.  This means you can essentially go Rog10-sd10 then ALL epic Assassin and it shouldnt break too much.  Its up to you.<script type="text/javascript"><!--

<i>What I was looking for was a better way of level progression for the three classes that would maximize BAB and AB. I need to keep the character human, so I took the advice, raised dex to 18, gained me one more AB and lowered con to 12.<br><br>So I guess in essence, with the three interchangable classes...is there a better way to arrange them to maximize BAB and AB?</i><br>_________________<br>All Who Wander Are Not Lost<script type="text/javascript"><!--
